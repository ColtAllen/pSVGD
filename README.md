Projected Stein variational methods for high-dimensional Bayesian inference as proposed in the following paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03469

The PDE model example is implemented in PDE_Models, using FEniCS as backend solver

The other models are implemented in nonPDE_Models, using HIPS/autograd to compute gradients
